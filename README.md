# Data Mangement Project Using SQL and Visio

In this project, our team tried to solve the database problem that a lot of small animal shelters are facing. The lack of database management system will make the shelters lose track of records such as animal adoption, vaccination, and training. Our team mapped put the entity relation diagram (ERD) using Visio (file name:OPIM5272_SecB12_Phasefinal_Team9ERD.vsdx) to demonstrate how each of the record related. Then, in the Oracle SQL database, our team built up tables (file name:OPIM5272_SecB12_Phasefinal_Team9Project tables.sql) for the entities we laid out in the ERD and inserted assumed values for each table. (file name:OPIM5272_SecB12_Phasefinal_Team9Project Values.sql) Finally, we wrote some queries to check if our assumed database would work. (file name:OPIM5272_SecB12_Phasefinal_Team9Query report.sql)
